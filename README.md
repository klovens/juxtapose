<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to Juxtapose, a Python tool that can be used to compare gene co-expression networks (GCNs). Juxtapose, together with different similarity measures, can be utilized for comparative transcriptomics between a set of organisms. While we focus on its application to comparing co-expression networks across species in evolutionary studies, Juxtapose is also generalizable to co-expression network comparisons across tissues or conditions within the same species. A word embedding strategy commonly used in natural language processing was utilized in order to generate gene embeddings based on walks made throughout the GCNs. 

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
